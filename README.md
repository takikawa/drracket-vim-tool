This plugin adds vim-like editing to DrRacket.

The plugin is still far from feature-complete, so bug reports and pull
requests appreciated!

Requires Racket v6.0 or newer.

To install:

  * `raco pkg install drracket-vim-tool` (via package catalog)

or

  * `raco pkg install	git://github.com/takikawa/drracket-vim-tool` (directly via Github)

Now when you load DrRacket, you should see a vim option in the
`Edit` menu. Click that to enable vim mode.

This plugin is released under the GPLv3. Patches welcome.
